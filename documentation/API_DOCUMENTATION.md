# API Documentation

This document provides instructions on accessing and testing the API endpoints.

## 1. Swagger Documentation

The application uses **Swagger** for API documentation. You can access it at the following URL after running the application:

- **Local Environment**:  
  `http://localhost:4100/docs`

- **Production Environment**:  
  `https://convertify.api.awesome-posts.com/docs`

---

## 2. Base API URL

- **Local Environment**:  
  `http://localhost:4100`

- **Production Environment**:  
  `https://convertify.api.awesome-posts.com`

## 3. Postman Collection

A **Postman Collection** is available for testing the API endpoints. This collection contains pre-configured requests for all available API endpoints.

### How to Use the Postman Collection:
1. Download the collection file (`convertify-postman-collection.json`) from the repository.
2. Import the collection into Postman:
   - Open Postman.
   - Click on **Import** in the top-left corner.
   - Select the `convertify-postman-collection.json` file.
3. Set the environment variables (e.g., `BASE_URL`) as required for local or production testing.
4. Use the requests in the collection to test the API endpoints.
